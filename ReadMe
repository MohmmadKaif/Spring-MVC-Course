*************************************This Is Our Spring Tutorial Project********************************************
In this demo we will see spring MVC.

Usual Servlet request handling flow.
View(Front End)------>web.xml(Deployment descriptor)--------->Servlets.



Spring MVC flow:
View(Front End)------>Servlet Dispatcher(a.k.a.Front Controller)--------->Controllers.



also one of the difference between Spring MVC and conventional servlets programming is that in Servlets for each Request Handling we were supposed to Create a new servlet.
But in Spring MVC we can have only one controller class and in that controller class we can have multiple methods to handle different request.

Look at this Demonstration and to understand more about it.
